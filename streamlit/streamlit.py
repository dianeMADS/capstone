    """For our project, we decided to focus on the Chicago Array of Things Dataset.  This massive dataset was collected between 2018 and 2020 from a node array installed throughout the city of Chicago.  Nodes have a variety of sensors installed at each location.  These sensors fall into one of six categories air quality, meteorological, physical, environmental, system, and vision.  For this analysis, we focus mainly on the air quality metrics.  This includes concentrations of five gasses: CO, H2S, NO2, O3, and SO2, as well as oxidizing and reducing gas concentrations. """)

Ideally, we would have hosted this data on a cloud server and maintained the column database format by using Cassandra or a similar database schema or migrated to a relational database format such as PostgreSQL, however, the dataset was over 300GB in size and pushed the cost too high for our project.  We instead elected to write our own program to reduce the file to a manageable size. """

This function splits the line by a comma and prints the line to a file with the name of value found in the second column (the node id).  This significantly reduce the size of each file we worked with but with the largest files around 10 GB, we still had to reduce the data.  Data was collected every second at each node.  We did not need this level of granularity and decided to average the readings every hour.  Theoretically, this would reduce our data by a factor of about 3600.  We completed this reduction in C# due to its speed and support for parallel processes, but a similar pipeline could be implemented in python. """

  st.markdown(
      """The process we used is only possible with the data was already sorted by ascending date.  The entire code can be found on our GitHub page.   The process was to first assign a thread to read a file.  The first line in the file becomes the start time rounded to the nearest half hour rounded down (ex 4:15 would have a start time at 3:30 and 4:45 would have a start time of 4:30) and the end time is the start time plus one hour.  A dictionary of values with the parameter, subsensor, and system as the key and the total for each as the values was then created.  Once the timestamp is greater than the end time or there are no more lines in the file to read, the thread takes the mean value for each key and appends it to a new csv file with the node id.  The values are cleared and the thread continues if there are more values in the file or moves on to the next file.  The entire process takes about 30 minutes to run, and we were able to reduce the size of the entire dataset from 300 GB down to 1.8 GB.  This size is near the limits for pandas but proved to be manageable after filtering by metrics for each analysis."""

We were expecting to find some similarity between nodes with each metric that may indicate differences or similarities between neighborhoods that are not physically close to each other.  The focus of this analysis is on the air quality metrics based on the concentrations of selected gasses.  This analysis does not explore what is “good” vs “bad” air quality, it instead focuses on identifying similar concentration levels of gasses over time. The results of this analysis may be interesting to correlate with other metrics such as income maps, housing prices, zoning (ex. business vs residential areas), and heath maps."""

The motivation for this comes from the assumption that there are differences in behavior on each weekday that may influence concentrations of gasses in the air such as differences between workday and weekend traffic (shape (number of nodes, 7 * parameters)).  The second representation averages all the values by date, combining the date in previous years together (shape = (number of nodes, 366*parameters)). Both representations do not include data collected during the lockdowns to prevent any lockdown related fluctuations from skewing the results.  Both data representations have their benefits.  The weekly representation reduces the daily noise significantly but loses much of the trends over the year that may be important for cluster separation.  The date representation maintains much of the trends but will place more weight on noisy data.  This representation also gives null values more weight since they must be treated as zeros."""

Due to the large daily fluctuations, we defined the number of clusters to be 5 instead of tuning for the distance threshold.  DBSCAN and OPTICS rely on identifying groupings of clusters.  These algorithms also identify noise points that are between clusters.  DBSCAN proved extremely difficult to generate reliable clusters.  Most of the runs produced a single cluster and noise points.  OPTICS is a generalized version of DBSCAN and was able to provide better results.  The spectral clustering algorithm had two clusters specified with the radial basis function as the affinity matrix.  Finally, affinity propagation was run as it attempts to determine how close two nodes are to being copies. This algorithm used the preset values suggested by the sklearn documentation with Euclidean distance in the affinity matrix."""

The plot below shows the clusters for the date representation.  The agglomerative clustering algorithm is the only one that appears to have some consistency in its clusters.  DBSCAN was run using a wide range of values for the eps parameter but it was never able to identify more than one cluster and noise.  OPTICS consistently provided a noise group and one or two clusters.  There appears to be a difference between the two clusters in the timeseries, but it is not clear why the separation occurred.  Both groups appear to have significant noise and inconsistent measurement across the timeframe.  The spectral clustering algorithm continually failed to provide fully connected graphs and thus produced unreliable cluster groups.  Affinity propagation produced 22 clusters with both data representations.  It is unclear why so many groups were produced but some differences in the active timeframes for each node and spikes in gas concentrations may account for some of the variability. """
